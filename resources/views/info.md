Hello there,<br>
<br>
This is an API, and it has some specific endpoints to work.<br>
<br>
The endpoint to make this work is <a target="_blank" href="/withdraw">here (/withdraw)</a>, so you can use the way that you want. 
<br>
<br>
This is a API, so to better test it, there is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> collection <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getpostman.com/collections/b90c0447290628ba144b">here</a> to use the endpoints.<br> 
The collection is based to use the address http:://localhost:8000.<br>
If a different address or port is used, the address must be changed at Postman as well.<br>
